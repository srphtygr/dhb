Lucien's playing with c and writing a recursive maze-solving program as a way to get feet wet and get better at c and git.
This is deliberately vintage K&R c and is actually being developed and run on pdp11 2.9bsd unix, so please enjoy the old school function declatations, int return assumptions, etc.  We're trying to keep it at least compilable (with warings) on newer bsd (like Macintosh), too.
