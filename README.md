Lucien's playing with c and writing a recursive maze-solving program as a way
to get feet wet and get better at c and git.  This is deliberately vintage K&R
c and is actually being developed and run on a real pdp11 2.9bsd unix
environment, so please enjoy the old school function declatations, int return
assumptions, etc.  We're trying to keep it at least compilable (with warings)
on newer bsd (like Macintosh), too.
